**SOLID** embraces a set of design principles related to software design of course, but they're not restricted to [OOPS](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP).

Introduced by Robert C. Martin from Agile, Principles, Patterns, and Practices. They're just a selection of five principles from a rather large number that are frequently referred to in modern design pattern literature.

Suggested order to follow the lessons on this chapter:

- SRP (Single Responsability Principle)
- OCP (Open-Closed Principle)
- LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)
- ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
- DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)
